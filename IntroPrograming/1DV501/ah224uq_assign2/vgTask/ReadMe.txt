birthday candels 
We begun by intializing the values canboxs, candles, sumboxs, box,
Since the assumption is that the person reaches 100 years, we made a for loop and put our range to 101. In the loop,
we had a while statement checking if candles are less then a year, Then the number of boxes are counted. At the same time candles and  canboxs were also summed.
To make things easier we used nested loops to check all the conditions and printed the values.

abcd.py
There are four digits that together form a number and "the number DCBA is equal to 4 times the number ABCD"
Here we needed to make the program figure out every possible digit for A, B, C and D respectively and find the 
right combination of them. So we used nested loops

countdigits
The task here was to input a large integer out of which you count the number of Zeros, Odd and Even numbers.
Since we have been introduced to method, i created a method that will check for Zeros, Odd and Even numbers.
In the method i intialized Zeros, Odd and Even numbers, then started with a nested loops. The for statement was looping through the large integer inputed.
whilst the if statements checked for Zeros, Odd and Even numbers. Any time either is found it is count and save.
Finally in the main i called the function and got the results printed.

salary revisions.
The task here was to take an input of arbitrary number of salaries (integers)  and find 
median and average salaries, and the salary gap. All of them should be integers (correctly rounded off).
I started the task by importing the statistics in the python libray. Then i created 3 methods def median(lst),def avrage(lst), and gab(lst).
The first 2 were pretty straight forward . In my gab method i took the maximum salary and subtrated the mimimun salary from it and returned the difference.
I called all the function in the main and printed out the results.
