## letter_count.py
In this task, we are to display a simple histogram.
 The program should read a text file and use a 
 dictionary to count the number of times (a-z, upper 
 case letters are counted as lower case letters) 
 is occurring in the files.
In this task i created three methods,
### count(lst)
The first method contains set of alphabet a-z, initialize to 0.
A for loop goes through the list and returns letter.
### make_histogram(letter)
This method takes the letter, checks the maximum values and append stars when the letter is found
### read_file(location)
The last method reads the files from the location and give it reading previllage.




## count_lines.py
The task here was to count the number os python code we have written so far.
 My approach was to create two methods.
 the first method.
 ### count_lines(file_path)
 This method counts the number of non empty 
 lines in one file.
 The second method 
 ### count_py_lines(path)
This method goes through all the files in a 
directory and its sub directories. When a python 
file is detcted, the count lines method is 
applied.



## pretty_print_subdirectories.py
The task here to to write a program that gives a pretty output.
### print_all_subdirectories(path)
